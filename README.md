# gnome-shell-extension-smartthermostat
A smart thermostat control and information widget for GNOME Shell.

So far the extension allows you to view the running status of your Ecobee thermostat.  We will be adding support to set the temperature soon.

Thank you to the authors of the Freon and OpenWeather extensions whom I forked some code from.
